I'm Saad an undergraduate CS student driven by curiosity, creativity, and determination.

My coding journey began with C++ and Java, sparking a love for solving complex problems and building meaningful mobile applications. Skilled in Dart and Flutter, I enjoy transforming ideas into cross-platform, user-friendly mobile experiences. Currently, I'm focused on mastering Flutter widgets and state management to strengthen my mobile development foundation, with plans to advance into advanced animations, custom widgets, and backend integrations.
